# Weather Trend Analysis-

Weather trends have always been a large factor in deciding where to go on vacation. To get a clear image of ideal conditions of various locations, weather data was collected from OpenweatherAPI and plotted to observe various trends in the data. The charts and dataframe was produced using MATPLOTLIB and PANDAS. Formatting was done using CSS and Bootstrap.
