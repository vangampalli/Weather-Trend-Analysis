# Web-Design-Challenge-

In this project, data from the previously completed API challenge is published onto github pages using HTML. Weather data were obtained through APIs from OpenweatherAPI. Charts and a Dataframe was produced using MATPLOTLIB and PANDAS. Formatting was done using CSS and Bootstrap.
